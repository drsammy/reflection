When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I use multiple computers or collaborate with other users, its always better to have a remote repository, since it is easily accessible.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes, I may want to add a feature to a repostory and in the meantime, someone else might have edited the code. I don't want remote to be updated while I'm working on the new feature.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking is like cloning a repository, but on github. So I take someone's repository and clone it into my account. The original owner is acknowledged. All changes that I make are in the copy present in my account. The original owner's repository won't get updated with my changes. I can ask the original owner to incorporate my changes. This way, I can modify someone else's code without changing his/her version of it.
